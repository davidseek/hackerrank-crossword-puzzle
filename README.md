# hackerrank-crossword-puzzle
My solution for the hackerrank crossword puzzle. To discuss possible improvements.

Disclaimer: My solution is heavily influenced by the discussions board.

I'm genuinly interested if someone has a better idea how to solve this.
My soltion works and was accepted by all test cases, ergo no execution time issues.
But the test case in the file took 46x times in median solve() executions and I can't imagine that this is the best approach.

My original idea was to create a map of all the locations and then check if the words would fit and go from there.
But as I didn't wanted to spend more time on this for right now, I finished it with the bruteforce solution.

Reach out and let me know what you think!
